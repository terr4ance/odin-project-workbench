        <h2>A Brief List Lacking Coherent Order</h2>

        <p>This is everything you need for a delectable meal.</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Gravy Granules</li>
            <li>Peas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Brief List Un-Lacking in Coherent Order</h2>

        <p>This is the order in which ingredients should be cooked.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, preheat the oven as specified on your chips packet and put the chips on a baking tray ready to go in.</li>
            <li>Boil the kettle and prepare a measuring jug, a small saucepan, and a frying pan.</li>
            <li>Heat a small volume of oil or butter in a frying pan and add the sausages, turning occasionally.</li>
            <li>Put the chips in the oven and start the relevant timer.</li>
            <li>When the sausages and chips are almost done, put the peas in boiling water and place over the hob to cook through.</li>
            <li>Make gravy according to the manufacturer's instructions using the meausuring jug.</li>
            <li><strong>Pile everything on a plate and there you go!</strong></li>
        </ol>
